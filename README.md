# FuckYouPayMe

This is a simple package developed for frustrated developers who are tired of clients not paying on time. Just add the following line beneath your body closing tag, and you are set!
`<script src="/node_modules/fuckyoupayme/dist/bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>` 

For additions/styling or changes to the modal that comes up: you can edit the files in the src folder to taste, and then run webpack in order to compile them into the bundle.js file. 

With thanks to the micromodal project!
